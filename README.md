Life Expectancy Prediction System
A machine learning project to predict life expectancy based on various health and socioeconomic factors.

Objective
Predict life expectancy to assist policymakers and healthcare professionals.
Build robust models to maximize prediction accuracy.
Deploy the best-performing model for real-world applications.

Life Expectancy: Target variable to predict.
Adult Mortality: Probability of dying between 15 and 60 years of age.
Infant Deaths: Number of infant deaths per 1000 live births.
Alcohol: Alcohol consumption per capita (in liters).
Percentage Expenditure: Expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP.
Hepatitis B: Immunization coverage percentage for Hepatitis B.
Measles: Number of reported measles cases per year.
BMI: Average Body Mass Index of the population.
